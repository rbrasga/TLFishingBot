to start running the bot go in the instument menu (f5) select song and click on ready. once in the performance screen the boot will take over and play some beautifull music

For the bot to work perfectly, you must put the exact directory of "imgs", for example, "C:/desktop/bot/imgs/Start.png" <- THE MOST IMPORTANT PART !
